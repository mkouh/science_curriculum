In this study, we applied natural language processing approaches to college-level, introductory science textbooks on physics, chemistry, and biology.  Term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf) metric was used to quantify the "informative-ness" of each term within the corpus.  These data- and computation-oriented techniques can be used to create visualizations that allow teachers and students to explore and discover topical relationships within and across disciplines more intuitively.  Our analysis also indicates that good multidisciplinary topics could include: radioactivity, energy, breathing, and climate change.
